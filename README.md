# Data-Challenge-2
In-Class kaggle competition 
In this data challenge we were given a supervised dataset of chest X-ray images, and were asked to train a model to detect the COVID-19 cases using neural network that gets the images from the input and predicts the labels of the images in the output. The dataset consisted 15264 (512x512) chest X-ray images for the train set and 400 images for the test set. The dataset contains positive and negative classes to indicate the positive and negative COVID-19 cases.
